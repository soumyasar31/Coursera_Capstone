    "Toronto and Mumbai are the financial capitals of Canada & India respectively. Both the cities are very different in many aspects like demography, climate, culture etc. At the same time both the cities are prominent tourist attractions due to their diverse, multicultural and wide range of experiences.  In this study we have grouped the neighbourhoods of Toronto & Mumbai to compare the similarities and differences."

We have obtained latitude and longitude of those places from the page https://cocl.us/Geospatial_data .\n",

    "b)\tMumbai Data – We have obtained all the Neighbourhoods of Mumbai along with postal codes, latitude & longitude from the website https://geographic.org/streetview/india/maharashtra/konkan/mumbai.html . However, I have saved the data in excel format after cleaning & sorting in the Github location https://github.com/soumyasar31/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Mumbai%20Neighbourhood.xls .\n",
    "\n",
    "c)\tFourSquare API Data – To obtain the venues of a neighbourhood, we have used the FourSquare API, which is a location data provided with all kinds of information on venues and events within an area. This includes venue name, category, reviews, images etc.  We have obtained list of venues around 500 meters of each neighbourhood. After obtaining the information, we have arranged the data by venue name & category for our exploratory data analysis and clustering of the neighbourhoods. We have also used the same data to find out top 5 categories of venue for each neighbourhood.\n"
